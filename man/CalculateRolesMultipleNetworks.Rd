\usage{
CalculateRolesMultipleNetworks(network_list, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{network_list}{A list of numeric biadjacency matrices representing interactions between two groups of nodes. Each row corresponds to a node in one level
and each column corresponds to a node in the other level. Elements of M are positive numbers if nodes do interact, and 0
otherwise. Formally, M is a biadjacency matrix. When nodes i and j interact, m_ij > 0; if they do not interact, m_ij = 0. Matrix can be binary or quantitative.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \code{bmotif}, such as whether motifs up to six nodes should be considered, and whether species roles should be based on
weighted or binary interactions. See \code{?node_positions} for details of the arguments that can be passed to \code{bmotif}.}
}
\value{
A list of length two, where the first element (\code{row_roles}) contains the roles of all row species from across all networks in \code{network_list} and the
second element (\code{column_roles}) contains the roles of all column species from across all networks in \code{network_list}.

Each element is a data frame with one row for each occurrence of each species. The first column is the network in which that row's species occurred. The second column
is the species name itself. Columns 3 onwards are one column for each node position: 23 columns if \code{six_node} is FALSE, and 74 columns if \code{six_node} is TRUE (depending on which was specified via
the optional arguments passed through to \code{bmotif} using the '\code{...}' argument; default is \code{six_node} is FALSE).

Columns names are given as "npx" where x is the ID of the position as described in Simmons et al. (2019) (and originally in Appendix 1 of Baker et al. (2015)). To view the 'motif dictionary' showing
which node position a given ID corresponds to, load \code{bmotif} via \code{library(bmotif)} then enter \code{vignette("bmotif-dictionary")}.

For a network with A rows and P columns, by default (where \code{level} = "all") the data frame has A + P rows, one for each node. If \code{level} = "rows", the data frame will have A rows, one for each row node;
if \code{level} = "columns", it will have P rows, one for each column node.

By default, the elements of this data frame will be the raw binary or weighted position measures (depending on which was requested). If \code{normalisation} is set to something other than "none", the elements will be
normalised position counts as described above.

If \code{weights_method} is set to 'all', \code{node_positions} instead returns a list of length five, each containing a data.frame corresponding to
one of the five weighting methods described above.
